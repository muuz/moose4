How to run:
1) Extract the tarball
2) Compile the code (javac *.java)
3) Start the server (java ConnectFour server)
4) Start the client (java ConnectFour client <IP> <PORT>)


Important notes:
	- depth is controlled by the value DEPTH in Constants.java
		- The actual depth value achieved is whatever is specified in
		DEPTH + 2
		- One extra because the first layer is not counted, the second
		is because we include index 0.
		- if DEPTH = 8, the depth it is computing is actually 10
	- the server and client are both run from the ConnectFour.java file
	- the server runs on port 44521
